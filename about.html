<h1 class="aboutheading">ABOUT ME</h1>

    <p class="aboutpara">Welcome to WM Nailbar, a home-based nail studio created with passion, creativity, and a love for self-expression. WM Nailbar was built on the idea that nails are more than just beauty — they are a reflection of your personality, mood, and style. Whether you’re feeling soft and elegant, bold and dramatic, trendy and playful, or clean and minimal, this is a space that caters to every vibe. <br> As a home-based studio, WM Nailbar offers a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere where clients can unwind and enjoy a personalized experience. Every appointment is focused on you — your preferences, your inspiration, and your vision. We take the time to understand exactly what you want and bring it to life with precision and attention to detail. <br> Quality and hygiene are top priorities at WM Nailbar. We use professional products and follow proper sanitation practices to ensure every service is not only beautiful but safe and long-lasting. From classic sets to custom nail art, each design is done with care, patience, and creativity. <br> Our mission is simple: to provide a welcoming space where everyone feels confident, valued, and empowered. When you leave WM Nailbar, you don’t just leave with great nails — you leave feeling polished, confident, and ready to take on the world.</p>
